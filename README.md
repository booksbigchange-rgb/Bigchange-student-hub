## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Backend** | NestJS, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, MySQL 8.0 |

| **File Storage** | MinIO (S3-compatible object storage) |
| **Caching** | Redis 7 |
| **Email** | Nodemailer (SMTP) with HTML templates |
| **Auth** | JWT + Passport.js + RBAC (11 roles) |
| **Monorepo** | Turborepo with npm workspaces |

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** and **npm 10+**
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sumitglobussoft/globussoft-school-mis.git
cd globussoft-school-mis
cp .env.example .env
npm install
```

> Phase 0: follow [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) to configure unique secrets first.
> Do not use real student data or run demo seeds. See [STABILIZATION.md](STABILIZATION.md) for release blockers.

### 2. Start Infrastructure

```bash
npm run docker:up    # Starts MySQL 8, Redis 7, MinIO
```

### 3. Database preparation (blocked for production)

Review the schema and migration history before provisioning an empty evaluation
database. The inherited seed scripts create demo accounts with predictable
passwords. Do not run them during stabilization or against production.

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1 — API Server (port 4002)
cd packages/api
npx nest build && node dist/main.js

# Terminal 2 — Web Dashboard (port 3001)
cd packages/web
npx next dev --port 3001
```

### 5. Access (Local)

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| **Web Dashboard** | http://localhost:3001 |
| **API** | http://localhost:4002/api/v1 |
| **MinIO Console** | http://localhost:9001 |

---

## Live Demo

The application is deployed and available for testing:

| Page | URL |
|---|---|
| **Landing Page** | https://globuslms.globusdemos.com |
| **Features** | https://globuslms.globusdemos.com/features |
| **Pricing** | https://globuslms.globusdemos.com/pricing |
| **Login** | https://globuslms.globusdemos.com/login |
| **API Docs (Swagger)** | https://globuslms.globusdemos.com/api/docs |

### Demo accounts

Inherited demo credentials are not deployment credentials. If demo seeds were
previously used, disable or securely reprovision those accounts before rollout.
